# ShowTopsAndBottoms.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert. It displays the bounding box tops and bottoms for each glyph in the Edit view, and marks them red if they are not inside an alignment zone.

![Tops and Bottoms.](ShowTopsAndBottoms.png "Show Tops and Bottoms")

After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Tops and Bottoms* (es: *Mostrar superiores e inferiores,* de: *Höchste und tiefste Stellen anzeigen,* nl: *Toon hoogste en laagste plekken,* fr: *Afficher les hauts et les bas,* zh: 显示底部到顶点的数值). You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.

### Installation

1. Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
2. Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
3. Restart Glyphs

### Usage Instructions

1. Open a glyph in Edit View.
2. Use *View > Show Tops and Bottoms* to toggle the display of bbox tops and bottoms.

### Requirements

The plugin works in Glyphs 2.2 or later, on OS X 10.11 or later. I can only test it in current app and OS versions, and perhaps it works on earlier versions too.
